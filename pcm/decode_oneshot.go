// DefaultMaxDecodedBytes is the ceiling DecodeInterleaved applies to its output.

// crafted or very long stream can decode to something huge; the one-shot helpers
// hold the whole decode in memory, so they stop at this ceiling rather than let a
// small input drive an unbounded allocation. It is 1 GiB, about 101 minutes of
// CD-quality (44.1 kHz, 16-bit) stereo S16.
//
// A caller decoding a stream it did not produce, or one legitimately longer than
// this, should use NewDecoder and stream the audio instead, which bounds memory
// to a single reusable buffer regardless of length.

// pcm.DecodeInterleaved). Output is S16 by default, or interleaved
// little-endian float32 when WithF32 is passed.
//
// It stops at DefaultMaxDecodedBytes and returns a wrapped ErrDecodeLimit if the
